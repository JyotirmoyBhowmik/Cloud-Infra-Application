## Implementation Details

### Database Schema

**Three New Tables:**

1. **organizational_units** - Stores OU/MG/Folder hierarchy
2. **landing_zones** - Stores landing zone configurations
3. **cloud_accounts** (Enhanced) - Now includes OU and LZ references

**Relationships:**
```
Tenant
  └── OrganizationalUnits (1:Many)
       └── OrganizationalUnits (Hierarchical)
            └── CloudAccounts (1:Many)
                 └── LandingZone (Reference)
```

### API Endpoints

**Organization Management:**
```
POST /organizations/sync        - Sync OU structure from provider
GET  /organizations/hierarchy   - Get hierarchical OU tree
GET  /organizations/accounts    - List all accounts in organization
```

**Landing Zone Management:**
```
POST /landing-zones            - Create landing zone
GET  /landing-zones/:id        - Get landing zone details
PUT  /landing-zones/:id/deploy - Deploy landing zone
```
